# d2l_brightspace_colour_profiles

As someone who has very sensitive eyes, particularly when coding at night... pulling up D2L aka brightspace can suck a lot with its light-mode only configuration. As a result I've begun to find ways to make dark-mode be a possibility, and after making several changes to various files, decided to make a public repo for everyone's benefit.

If other people want other colour modes, open an issue or contribute to the code base!
